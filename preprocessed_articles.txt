title considerations and derivations of permitted daily exposure limits for impurities from intravitreal pharmaceutical products
abstract intravitreal ivt injection is an uncommon route of parenteral administration for therapeutic medications but one of the most important for the treatment of ocular diseases especially those related to macular degeneration nonetheless there are currently no regulatory guidelines that specifically address how to establish a permitted daily exposure pde for impurities and residual process reagents in ivt pharmaceutical drug products given the unique vulnerability of ocular tissues the establishment of pdes for ivt administration is complicated by the limited understanding of metabolism and clearance of small molecular weight chemicals from the human vitreous humor vh a problem compounded by the limited ivtspecific toxicological data in this paper we describe a feasible and comprehensive methodology for deriving pde limits for impurities and residual process reagents from ivt drug products as exemplified by five case studies including inorganic elements formic acid polyethylene glycols acetic acid and caprolactam the five case studies were selected to cover compounds with a wide range of impurity sources and toxicological data availability the proposed framework considers both local ocular and systemic toxicity endpoints and advances the goal of a harmonized sciencebased approach for deriving ivt pde limits

title gene therapy for geographic atrophy in agerelated macular degeneration current insights
abstract geographic atrophy ga is the advanced stage of nonneovascular dry agerelated macular degeneration defined by the presence of sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina the complement system is integral to the bodys natural immune response and hence its overactivation can lead to tissue damage and inflammation it has been shown to play a significant role in ga lesion development and progression and therefore complement inhibition is emerging as a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention with the recent approval by the food and drug administration of drugs like syfovre pegcetacoplan injection and izervay avacincaptad pegol intravitreal solution there is hope for the development of interventions capable of slowing down or arresting the progression of ga in particular gene therapy intervention is gaining traction for halting ga atrophy at the source of our genes the concept is to insert a gene into the eye that will act as an ocular biofactory producing a desired protein this can either lead to overproduction of an already available protein or produce a substance not typically generated in the eye this review aims to provide an overview of the present understanding of ga encompassing risk factors prevalence pathophysiology and genetic associations it will also highlight the current landscape of ga treatment with particular emphasis on gene therapy intervention

title choroidal macrophages in homeostasis aging and agerelated macular degeneration
abstract with increasing age the optimal functioning of the choroid is essential for efficient removal of waste products formed from photoreceptor renewal a decline in regulatory elements of the immune system termed immunosenescence and the failure of parainflammation to restore tissue homeostasis can result in the progression of healthy aging to sightthreatening inflammation of the choroid macrophages are uniquely situated between the innate and adaptive immune systems with a high capacity for phagocytosis recognition of complement components as well as antigen presentation in this review we provide an overview of macrophages and their properties in the healthy choroid and cover the impact of aging immunosenescence and inflammaging on the function of choroidal macrophages we will discuss the impact of age on macrophage phenotype and behaviour in the pathophysiology of agerelated macular degeneration
title impact of deprivation and preferential usage on functional connectivity between early visual cortex and categoryselective visual regions
abstract human behavior can be remarkably shaped by experience such as the removal of sensory input many studies of conditions such as stroke limb amputation and vision loss have examined how removal of input changes brain function however an important question yet to be answered is when input is lost does the brain change its connectivity to preferentially use some remaining inputs over others in individuals with healthy vision the central portion of the retina is preferentially used for everyday visual tasks due to its ability to discriminate fine details when central vision is lost in conditions like macular degeneration peripheral vision must be relied upon for those everyday tasks with some portions receiving preferential usage over others using restingstate fmri collected during total darkness we examined how deprivation and preferential usage influence the intrinsic functional connectivity of sensory cortex by studying individuals with selective vision loss due to late stages of macular degeneration specifically we examined functional connectivity between categoryselective visual areas and the cortical representation of three areas of the retina the lesioned area a preferentially used region of the intact retina and a nonpreferentially used region we found that cortical regions representing spared portions of the peripheral retina regardless of whether they are preferentially used exhibit plasticity of intrinsic functional connectivity in macular degeneration cortical representations of spared peripheral retinal locations showed stronger connectivity to mt a region involved in processing motion these results suggest that the longterm loss of central vision can produce widespread effects throughout spared representations in early visual cortex regardless of whether those representations are preferentially used these findings support the idea that connections to visual cortex maintain the capacity for change well after critical periods of visual development
title applying low levels of strain to model nascent phenomenon of retinal pathologies
abstract agerelated macular degeneration amd is a leading cause of vision loss in aging populations a better understanding of the mechanisms of the disease especially at early stages could elucidate new treatment targets one characteristic of amd is strain on the retinal pigment epithelium rpe a crucial layer of the retina this strain can be caused by physical phenomena like waste aggregation underneath the rpe drusen formation or leaky blood vessels that infiltrate the retina during choroidal neovascularization cnv it is not well understood how strain affects rpe cell function most models generate equibiaxial strain or higher levels of strain that are not representative of early stages of amd to overcome these issues we engineered a device to cause controlled low amounts of localized radial strain maximum this strain level is more mimetic to what occurs during aging or at the beginning of physical disruptions experienced during amd to evaluate how rpe cells respond to this physical stimulus primary porcine rpe cells were exposed to low levels of strain applied by our custommade device cell secretions and genetic expression were analyzed to determine how proteins linked to drusen and cnv are affected the results indicate that this low amount of strain does not immediately initiate angiogenesis but causes changes in mrna expression of amyloid precursor protein app which plays a role in retinal health and drusen accumulation this research offers insight into amd progression as well as the health of other organs including the brain
